# Simple Banking System

Welcome to a simple banking system that allows you to create and manage bank accounts using an SQLite database.

The application automatically generates an account number and a PIN, which are used to log into the system. This data is added to a database that allows for easy and quick account management.

The system allows you to add revenues and make transfers to other bank accounts in the database. The user also has the option of removing his account from the database and checking the account status at any time.
